Thank you for the consideration. 

I have created the web page from the Figma mockup. My philosophy is to keep things as simple as possible. The page was created with HTML and CSS. I did however separate the main sections of the page into individual components in order to simplify any changes that need to be done to the codebase. 

I also create a text.json file (./src/assets/text.json) that contains all the copy in a single document and is  linked to all the components. This creates global variables that can be changed in a single place and will affect all versions of the webpage.

I used a simple CSS onHover in order to change the button element. This could also be done using React UseState hook.

The webpage is deployed and hosted using GitHub pages.
